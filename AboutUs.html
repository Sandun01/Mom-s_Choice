<h1>The Story about Mom's Choice</h1>
<p>
Mom's Choice was founded in Colombo, Sri Lanka in 2007 by Gehan Blok and Dino Corera. They began by selling toys, apparel and accessories before deciding that apparel had the most growth potential.
By the early 2010s, Mom's Choice was repositioned as a specialty retailer of children's apparel for newborns to pre-teens and began offering private label merchandise as well as branded product.
In 2013, Ushitha Perera took the helm as President & Chief Executive Officer. Ushitha quickly established four Strategic Growth Initiatives for the company to maximize our long-term potential: Superior Product, Business Transformation through Technology, Alternate Channels of Distribution and Fleet Optimization. In order to support our key strategic initiatives, Ushitha also established a best in class management team and a foundation of operational excellence. Our successful execution of these four Strategic Growth Initiatives have transformed Mom's Choice from what was a predominately Brick and Mortar home-grown retailer when Ushitha arrived, to the Global Best in Class Omni Channel Kids Specialty Retailer that we are today!
<br></p>
